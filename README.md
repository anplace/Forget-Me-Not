# Note Taker Application
A website to record and save notes. We were given starter code for this application. The main focus was to create the server.js file and then populate with dependencies, routes, etc.

### Purpose 
To assist a small business owner with writing and saving notes so they can better run their business. This is a fantastic way to keep track of meeting notes, site visits, sales calls, or whatever the business may require.
